## Usage

### Training

To train VLM with verl:

```bash
./train.sh
```

### Evaluation

To test VLM on ScreenSpot:

```bash
python ./screenspot/test.py
```

To test VLM on ScreenSpot-Pro:

```bash
python ./screenspot/test-pro.py
```

## Acknowledgement

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Yan Ma for his invaluable and highly insightful discussions.
